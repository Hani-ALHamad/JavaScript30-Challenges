# JavaScript 30 Days Challenges (js30)

**• Javascript30 is a free 30 days challenges course.**

**• I solved them using my own approach, without seeing the final js files or the videos.**

**• I did the javascript part only, didn't touch the HTML/CSS files in most of them.**

**• Vanilla Javascript only was used to solve them.**

**• My solutions are named "my_js.js"**

• 9 and 14 were simple and more like tutorials for me, i just watched them and typed the notes in their HTML files (open f12 in browser), same goes with 25 but in JS file not html.
